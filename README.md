# Tom Reno Portfolio (MVP)

## Notes

This site was built completely from scratch with out any libraries or frameworks or googled code (with the exception of normalize.css and a simple library to make setting up animations easier). The images have not been compressed yet and the scroll position on the modal window isn't returning to 0 on close. The CSS and JS are the minimum to launch the site.

## Old work

My previous portfolio (now untouched for 7 years) is still available here:
