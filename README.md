# Tom Reno Portfolio (MVP)

## Notes

This site was built completely from scratch without any libraries or frameworks (with the exception of normalize.css and a simple library to make setting up animations easier). The images have not been compressed yet and the scroll position on the modal window isn't returning to 0 on close. There are still a few small issues to sort out on mobile â€” for now it's best viewed on a desktop. 

## Old work

My previous portfolio (now untouched for 7 years) is still available here: http://tomrenodesign.com/portfolio
